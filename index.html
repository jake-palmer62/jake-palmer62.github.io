      <h2>Education amd Experience</h2>
      <h3>Computer Science BSc, Cardiff University 2021-2024</h3>
      <p>During my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to complete my dissertation which was ‘Developing a Framework for the Forensic Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems’. This focused on integrating machine learning<br>
         techniques and statistical methods which used datasets involving water storage tanks and gas pipelines to classify cyber-attacks on their control systems, which required a high level of data processing and attention to<br>
         detail, as the slightest deviation in this data could have been indicative of a cyber-attack. I have also led a project developing a fully functional web scraper, semantically classifying posts from Reddit based on their <br>
         reception by other users and the tone of the post, which took an agile development approach. During my time at Cardiff, I have also actively participated in both their cyber-society and the e-sports society, having participated<br>
         in events like Hack the Box capture the flag competitions. While I was at Cardiff, I also had the privilege of being a student representative, providing feedback from our cohort on teaching and support from the University.<br>
         I also completed the Cardiff Award, which involved voluntary work and attending employability skills workshops. Now, I am currently pursuing my master’s degree in advanced computer science, which again has a strong <br>
         focus on machine learning and data science as well as cybersecurity and risk management.  </p>

      <h3>Play and Respite Support Worker, Torfaen Play 2019-2024</h3>
      <p>As a play and respite support worker at Torfaen Play, I provided care and respite for children with disabilities and complex additional learning needs, ensuring a safe and positive environment during play sessions. I have <br>
        also taken on the role of Paediatric First Aider, addressing any minor injuries or incidents during these sessions, and have had the opportunity to liaise with parents to provide feedback and updates on their children’s experiences <br>
        throughout each session. I have also developed skills in teamwork and leadership by collaborating with other staff members to coordinate activities and support the needs of each child. I was also able to develop problem-solving skills <br>
        through adapting these activities to suit every child ensuring a safe environment.</p>

      <div class="project">
        <h3>Creating a Framework for the Forensic Analysis of Cyber-Physical Systems</h3>
        <p>The primary aim of this project is to create a detailed framework that guides the forensic analysis of cyber-physical systems (CPS) following a security breach, with a focus on correlating the digital evidence with the physical consequences of the attack.<br><br>
          This project was completed mainly using Python and FactoryIO, with libraries like pandas, matplotlib and sklearn to analyse the data.

        <h3>Reddit Web Scraper</h3>
        <p>This was a tool to scrape Reddit to determine the semantic value of a post, either positive, negative or neutral. This was a group project that I completed during my second year at Cardiff and utilises the Reddit API<br><br>
        This project was completed mainly using SQLite, Python and the Flask framework.</p>

        <h3>Creating a fully functional Record Shop.</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project was to create a functioning shopping website using Python and Flask. I designed and implemented a functional website which allowed the user to browse and buy records, and allowed the administrator to determine stock levels.

        <h3>Plant Health Monitoring System</h3>
        <p>The aim of this project was to use an Arduino Uno with temperature, humidity and air pressure sensors along with a camera to remotely monitor the health of a plant. I completed most of the backend of this project using C++ to make <br>
        each sensor work and record values periodically to a .CSV file using Python. This also required the implementation of a web app so that the end-user could access the monitor remotely.</p>
